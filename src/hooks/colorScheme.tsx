/*

Color Scheme hook for dark mode/light mode based on device settings, including change listeners.

Extracted functionality to this file such that if we ever need to expand upon the functionality of light/dark
mode management, we can do so here and return the values from a centralised location.

Returns "light", "dark", or null if unavailable.

Available on iOS 13+ and Android 10+ (API level 29)
